# Kabuki-Kitchen

The "Kabuki Kitchen" GitHub repository is a dynamic project incorporating cutting-edge technologies for both the client and server components. Here's a breakdown of the key technologies used in each section:

Client (Public):

- Vite.js: The client-side utilizes Vite.js for fast and efficient development. Vite is a modern build tool that offers lightning-fast bundling and hot module replacement, enabling rapid iteration and a smooth development experience.
  Bootstrap: Bootstrap is employed for responsive and sleek user interface design. It provides a robust set of CSS and JavaScript components, making it easier to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.
- Axios: Axios is used for handling HTTP requests from the client-side code. It provides a simple and intuitive API for making asynchronous requests to the server, fetching data, and handling responses efficiently.

Server:

- Node.js: The server-side of the Kabuki Kitchen application is built on Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime environment. Node.js allows for scalable and high-performance server-side applications, handling concurrent connections and I/O operations efficiently.
  Express: Express.js is employed as the web application framework for Node.js. Express simplifies the process of building robust APIs and web servers, providing middleware for handling requests, routing, and processing data.
- Sequelize: Sequelize is utilized as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for interacting with the database. It abstracts away the complexities of database queries, allowing developers to work with JavaScript objects instead of raw SQL, thus streamlining database operations.
- Multer: Multer is used for handling file uploads on the server-side. It enables easy and secure file upload functionality, allowing users to upload images or other files as part of their interactions with the Kabuki Kitchen application.
- Axios: Axios is also utilized on the server-side for making outgoing HTTP requests to external services or APIs. It provides a consistent interface for sending requests and handling responses, ensuring seamless integration with external resources.
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): JWT is employed for user authentication and authorization. It enables secure transmission of information between the client and server by encoding user information into a JSON-based token, which can be verified and trusted.
- bcrypt: bcrypt is used for hashing user passwords before storing them in the database. It ensures that user passwords are securely encrypted, protecting user accounts from unauthorized access in the event of a data breach.
- Cloudinary: Cloudinary is utilized for storing and managing user-uploaded images and other media files. It provides a cloud-based media management platform with features for uploading, storing, transforming, and delivering images and videos, enhancing the multimedia capabilities of the Kabuki Kitchen application.

By leveraging these technologies, the Kabuki Kitchen project delivers a robust and feature-rich application with a responsive client interface powered by Vite.js and Bootstrap, and a scalable and efficient server backend built on Node.js, Express, Sequelize, Multer, and Axios. With the addition of JWT token, bcrypt, and Cloudinary, the Kabuki Kitchen project enhances its security, authentication, and media management capabilities, ensuring a robust and secure application environment for both users and administrators.
